Why Pipenv?
-----------

Packaging in Python can be a pain, but it doesn't need to be. The new Pipenv project
has rapidly improved packaging in Python by tackling two related problems: automatic
package dependency management and virtualenv management. Pipenv uses the new Pipfile_
format that is the endorsed replacement for `requirements.txt`. Pipenv is the future of
Python package management, and is even recommended to newcomers in the Python tutorial_.

Features
--------

* Testing setup with ``unittest`` and ``python setup.py test`` or ``py.test``
* Travis-CI_: Ready for Travis Continuous Integration testing
* Tox_ testing: Setup to easily test for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
* Sphinx_ docs: Documentation ready for generation with, for example, ReadTheDocs_
* Bumpversion_: Pre-configured version bumping with a single command
* Auto-release to PyPI_ when you push a new tag to master (optional)
* Command line interface using Click (optional)

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Install the latest Pipenv::

    pip install -U pipenv

Generate a Python project that uses Pipenv::

    cookiecutter gh:elgertam/cookiecutter-pipenv

Once your project has been created, change directories::

    cd <project-name>

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (``pipenv install --dev``)
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Register_ your project with PyPI.
* Run the Travis CLI command `travis encrypt --add deploy.password` to encrypt your PyPI password in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
* Add the repo to your ReadTheDocs_ account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_.

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project itself is a fork of Audrey Roy Greenfield's exceptional
cookiecutter-pypackage_. If you have differences in your preferred setup, I
encourage you to fork this to create your own version. Or create your own;
it doesn't strictly have to be a fork.
